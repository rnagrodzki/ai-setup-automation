# Architecture

## Overview

This repository serves two roles:

1. **Marketplace** — The root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` makes the repo installable
   as a Claude Code marketplace
2. **Plugin** — One plugin lives under `plugins/ai-setup-automation/` (AI config scaffolding
   and evolution) with its own skills, commands, hooks, and scripts

## How It Works

### Marketplace Layer

The root `marketplace.json` tells Claude Code: "This repository contains plugins. Here
is where to find them." It lists each plugin with a name and a relative source path.

When a user runs `/plugin marketplace add rnagrodzki/ai-setup-automation` in Claude Code:

1. Clones or references this repository
2. Reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
3. Discovers the listed plugins and makes them available to browse

No plugins are installed yet at this point. The user must then run `/plugin install aisa@ai-setup-automation` (or use the interactive **Discover** tab in `/plugin`) to install each plugin.

**Important:** The `name` in each `marketplace.json` plugin entry must match the `name` in the corresponding `plugin.json`. A mismatch causes "plugin not found" errors when users try to update via the `/plugin` UI, because Claude Code looks up the installed plugin identity (from `plugin.json`) in the marketplace catalog.

### Plugin Layer

Each plugin has its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` that declares:
- **name** and **description** — Identification
- **version** — Semantic version for tracking updates
- **author** — Who maintains this plugin

### Name Resolution

When a plugin is loaded from a marketplace, Claude Code prefixes all commands and skills
with the plugin's `name` (from `plugin.json`), using the format `<plugin-name>:<item-name>`.

**Commands** — invoked as `/<plugin-name>:<command-name>`:

| File | `plugin.json` `name` | Resolved command |
|---|---|---|
| `commands/setup.md` | `aisa` | `/aisa:setup` |
| `commands/review.md` | `aisa` | `/aisa:review` |

**Skills** — referenced as `<plugin-name>:<skill-name>`:

| Directory | `plugin.json` `name` | Resolved name |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/aisa-scaffolder/` | `aisa` | `aisa:aisa-scaffolder` |
| `skills/aisa-syncer/` | `aisa` | `aisa:aisa-syncer` |

The `name` field in `plugin.json` is the namespace prefix — **not** the directory name. Keep it
stable — renaming it changes every command and skill name for all installed users.

### Skills

Skills are directories under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/`. Each skill directory must
contain a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: "When Claude should invoke this skill (max 1024 characters)"
argument-hint: "[optional-arg]"   # shown in the UI when user types the skill name
user-invocable: false             # hide from the / menu (Claude can still auto-invoke)
---
```

**Frontmatter fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Yes | Skill identifier (max 64 characters). Combined with plugin name to form `<plugin>:<skill>`. |
| `description` | Yes | When Claude should invoke this skill (max 1024 characters). Write as a trigger condition, not a summary. |
| `argument-hint` | No | Hint shown in the UI when the user types the skill name. |
| `user-invocable` | No | Set to `false` to hide from the `/` menu. Claude can still auto-invoke it. Default: `true`. |

The `description` field is critical — Claude uses it to decide when to activate the skill.

Supporting files (`.md` templates, checklists, scripts) live alongside `SKILL.md` in
the same directory. Reference them with relative paths like `./supporting-file.md`.

### Commands

Commands are `.md` files under `plugins/<plugin>/commands/`. The filename (without `.md`)
becomes the slash command name. Each file has YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: "Short description shown in command list"
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash]
---
```

For example, `commands/setup.md` creates the `/setup` command.

### Hooks

Hooks are defined in `plugins/<plugin>/hooks/hooks.json`. Available hook points:

| Hook | When It Fires |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | When a Claude Code session begins |
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool is invoked (use `matcher` to filter by tool name) |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool completes |

## Adding a New Plugin

To add another plugin to this marketplace:

1. Create `plugins/<new-plugin-name>/` with its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
2. Add an entry to the root `marketplace.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "new-plugin-name",
     "source": "./plugins/new-plugin-name"
   }
   ```

3. Follow the same structure: `skills/`, `commands/`, `hooks/` (and optionally `scripts/`)
